Currently I am working for Time Warner Cable as a backbone capacity planner. Previously, I worked for Network Research Center at Tsinghua University. Before joining Tsinghua, I was a Sr. Network Engineer at Verizon Business (fMCI/fUUNET) to design, optimize and maintain its public IP network (known as AS701/702/703). Before that, I worked for Juniper Networks as a customer support engineer to support tier-1 ISPs.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Computer Science Department, North Carolina State University in 2002, under the supervision of Prof. S. Felix Wu. After my graduation, I went to USC/ISI - East for a two-year post-doc training on BGP related research.

I am happily living with my wife Kai, my son Andrew and daughter Kaylee in Northern Virginia.
