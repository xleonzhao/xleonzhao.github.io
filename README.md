# Xiaoliang "Leon" Zhao

I am a network engineer and a programmer. Previously I was working for Time Warner Cable (acquired by Charter Communications) as a backbone capacity planner. Before that I worked for Network Research Center at Tsinghua University. Before joining Tsinghua, I was a Sr. Network Engineer at Verizon Business (fMCI/fUUNET) to design, optimize and maintain its public IP network (known as AS701/702/703). Before Verizon, I worked for Juniper Networks as a customer support engineer to support tier-1 ISPs. ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xleonzhao/))

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Computer Science Department, North Carolina State University in 2002, under the supervision of [Prof. S. Felix Wu](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~wu/). After my graduation, I went to USC/ISI - East for a two-year post-doc training on BGP related research. ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e1kOt7YAAAAJ&hl=en))

I am happily living with my family in Virginia, United States.
