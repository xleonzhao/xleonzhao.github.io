# Xiaoliang "Leon" Zhao

I am a network engineer and programmer with extensive experience across multiple roles since 2004. My career has spanned network engineering at Verizon Business (AS701/702/703), backbone capacity planning at Time Warner Cable (now Charter Communications), network management at Tsinghua University, and network automation at Verisign.

Over the years, I have gained deep expertise in routing protocols such as BGP and IPv6, as well as various engineering aspects of large-scale ISP networks, including design, planning, optimization, operations, and automation. I am highly focused on delivering efficient, high-quality solutions and ensuring projects are completed on time.

In addition to networking, I am a skilled programmer proficient in Python, Perl, and C. My recent work includes developing the "ipmem" module, which enhances KVM-based virtual machines by enabling dynamic memory expansion.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Computer Science Department, North Carolina State University in 2002, under the supervision of [Prof. S. Felix Wu](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~wu/). After my graduation, I went to USC/ISI - East for a two-year post-doc training on BGP related research. ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e1kOt7YAAAAJ&hl=en))

I am happily living with my family in Virginia, United States.
